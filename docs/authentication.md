### Authentication

There are a number of ways a client may authenticate itself with the
REST API. These methods include:

* Cookies
* HTTP Signatures

#### Cookies

This method of authentication is useful for clients that are under your
control and who you trust with your password to the service.

#### HTTP Signatures

HTTP Signature-based authentication which is useful for non-interactive clients,
and clients that you do not want to provide a password for.
